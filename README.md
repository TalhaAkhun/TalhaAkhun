<h3>Get to know me better</h3>
<p>- A multi-skilled FullStack developer with hands-on experience in developing. I graduated from Microverse, where people from all over the world join together to build different projects. I've spent the last several months completely immersed in remote development, pair-programmming, and building webpages with JavaScript, React/Redux, and Ruby/Rails.</p>

<br>

<p>- On my previous professional experiences, I have worked as an executive pilot, where I learned several skills I now use every day as a developer: effective problem-solving, great communication, multi-tasking, and more. I also worked as a video/image editor, where I built strong skills related to Adobe Photoshop, that helps on front-end projects, and also strengthened my ability to connect with clients.
